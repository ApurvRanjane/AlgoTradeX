# 🚀 AlgoTradeX – Zerodha-Style Trading Platform (UI Complete + Partial Functionality)

AlgoTradeX is a Zerodha-inspired trading platform clone built using the MERN stack.  
The UI is fully designed, and some backend features are functional, making it a solid learning-level project for understanding trading dashboards, APIs, and full-stack workflows.

This project helped me practice React, Bootstrap, REST APIs, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication.
